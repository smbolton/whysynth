WhySynth mutated out of Xsynth-DSSI, and a few bits of code may
remain from the original Xsynth v1.0.2, copyright (c) 1999 S. J.
Brookes, under the GNU General Public License version 2.

Portions of the minBLEP oscillator code are based on Fons
Adriaensen's VCO-plugins v0.3.0, copyright (c) 2003 under the GNU
General Public License version 2.  (Thanks also to Daniel Werner for
his public domain minBLEP generation code, upon which I based my
discontinuity-delta generation code).

The MVCLPF-3 filter was taken directly from Fons Adriaensen's
MCP-plugins v0.3.0, copyright (c) 2003 under the GNU General Public
License version 2.

The amSynth 4P-LPF filter comes from Nick Dowell's amSynth,
copyright (c) 2001,2002 Nick Dowell, under the GNU General Public
License version 2.

The asynchronous granular synthesis implementation was inspired by
MSS, (c) 2002 Mats Olsson.  Some of the grain envelope code comes
directly from Mats.

The PADsynth implementation began as Nasca O. Paul's public domain
example code.

Major portions of the event handling code are derived from
Fluidsynth, copyright (c) 2003 Peter Hanappe and others, under the
GNU General Public License version 2.

Portions of the DSSI interface and OSC handling code come from Chris
Cannam and Steve Harris's public domain DSSI example code.

The GTK+ knob code was adapted from gAlan 0.2.0, copyright (c) 1999
Tony Garnock-Jones.

The wavecycle data was in part resynthesized from Claude Kaber's
Virtual K4 soundfont, and from //christian's exegesis of the Ensoniq
SQ-80 wavetable ROMs.

The Kellet pink noise filter and reson{r,z} filters come from
Csound, copyright (c) 1999 Sean Costello, rasmus ekman, et. al.

Nearly all of the Plate reverb code comes from the Plate2x2
reverb in CAPS 0.2.3, copyright (c) 2002-4 Tim Goetze.

The SC Reverb is Sean Costello's reverb from Csound, C implement-
ation copyright (c) 2005 Istvan Varga under the GNU Lesser General
Public License version 2.1.

Luke Andrew contributed a refactoring of the Chamberlin SVF, with
additional modes, to "help fill out the 'filter type' knob" on his
uber-cool hardware controller for WhySynth.  Take a look at

Jonathan H. Pickard contributed support for panning of the output
mix via MIDI control change 10.

Much of the original code in WhySynth would not have been possible
without the generous availability of the work of Tim Stilson, Julius
Smith, Eli Brandt, John Chowning, Curtis Roads, and a slew of other
pioneers.
